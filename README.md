# Theta and PHI
theta -> angle from positive **Z** axis towards positive **X** axis
- theta range [0 - 180] degrees OR [0 - PI] radians
phi -> angle from positive **X** axis towards positive **y** axis
- phi range [0 - 360] degrees OR [0 - 2PI] radians

# Orbitals
**1S** -> (n = 1 l = 0 m = 0)
**2S** -> (n = 2 l = 0 m = 0)
**2Px** -> (n = 2 l = 1 m = 0)
**2Pz** -> (n = 2 l = 1 m = 1)
**2Py** -> (n = 2 l = 1 m = -1)
